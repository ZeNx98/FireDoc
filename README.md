<h1 align="center">FireDoc</h1>

<p align="center">A beautiful, minimalist PDF viewer and editor for Firefox with a distraction-free interface</p>

---

## What is this?

Firefox comes with a great built-in PDF viewer and editor, but using it solely as a PDF reader may not be visually appealing due to its web browser user interface. Fortunately, the FireDoc installation script can create a separate profile dedicated to reading and editing PDFs. Additionally, the script adds custom CSS to hide the browser's UI elements, giving the appearance of a dedicated PDF reader.

## üé® Customization

FireDoc stores its configuration files in `~/.config/firedoc/` with the following structure:

### Configuration Files

```
~/.config/firedoc/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png              # Application icon
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ startpage.html        # Custom start page UI
```

### Customizing the Start Page
Edit `~/.config/firedoc/startpage.html` to customize:
- Colors and theme
- Layout and styling  
- Welcome message
- Feature cards

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **PDF Rendering**: PDF.js library (v3.11.174)
- **Storage**: localStorage for metadata, thumbnails
- **Profile**: Isolated Firefox profile

### Storage Limits
- **Recent Files**: Up to 10 files (configurable)
- **Thumbnail Size**: ~10-20KB per file
- **Total Storage**: ~5MB for all thumbnails (localStorage limit)

### Browser Compatibility
- **Tested**: Firefox (latest versions)
- **Platform**: Linux 
- **Note**: May require adjustments for other platforms

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Large PDFs Not Showing Thumbnails
- Large PDFs (>100MB) may take longer to generate previews
- If preview fails, a placeholder icon is shown

### Recent Files Not Persisting
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Verify `~/.config/firedoc/` directory has write permissions
- Clear browser cache if issues persist

### FireDoc Not Appearing in App Launcher
```bash
# Reinstall desktop entries
bash install.sh
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
```

### PDFs Opening in Default Browser
