**A minimalist, privacy-focused PDF viewer built with Electron and Mozilla's PDF.js**

## What is FireDoc?

Firefox‚Äôs built-in PDF viewer is solid, but its browser interface can feel cluttered for reading. FireDoc fixes that by being fully standalone‚Äîbuilt with Electron and PDF.js‚Äîwith no Firefox, no browser UI, no cloud services, and no tracking. Just a clean, lightweight app that runs entirely on your device, giving you a fast, distraction-free way to read and edit PDFs.

##  Features

- **Minimalist Interface** ‚Äî Clean design inspired by Firefox
- **Recent Files Panel** ‚Äî Automatic thumbnails and quick reopening of recent documents
- **Dark Theme** ‚Äî Easy on the eyes with Firefox-inspired colors
- **File Associations** ‚Äî Set FireDoc as your default PDF viewer
- **Offline First** ‚Äî Works completely offline, no internet required
- **Cross-Platform** ‚Äî Built with Electron for Linux (Windows/Mac support coming soon!)
